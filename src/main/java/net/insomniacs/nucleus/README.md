# A guide to nucleus

Nucleus is an API mod by the Insomniacs dev team to provide a few core functions to our mods.

### Features
- Inbuilt methods for rendering 3D items as sprites in inventory
- Component system
  - Entity data attachment system
  - Server ticking attachments
  - Entity ticking attachments
- More to come

### Usage
The code itself is documented with JavaDocs so many methods already have fully fledged explanations attached to them.
However, a basic tutorial for the various features provided by the API will come at a later date.

It is advised however that you stay out and away from any of the classes within the impl package. 
As is standard for API's the files in impl are volatile and likely to change more than the API hooks are.
